In order to run this program do the following steps:

javac Project3.java
java Project3

The first thing you are prompted by when you start the program is the file allocation method to use. Here if you want Contiguous choose 1, Chained choose 2, Indexed choose 3. After you enter one of the three you are then taking to the UI. When copying a file from the real system to the simulation the program wil ask to "Copy From:" meaning which file in the real system do you want to copy. It will then ask "Copy To:" meaning what do you want to name the file when it is in the similation. The same is true for copying a file from the similation to the real system. Here it will give the prompt "Copy From:" meaning that it is asking for the name of the file in the similation that you would like to copy over, it will then give the prompy "Copy To:" meaning it is asking what do you want to name the file when it is in the real system.
